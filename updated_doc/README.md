# Machine Learning Hands-On Guide

Hi, in this guide we are going to deeply learn about machine learning's fundamental concepts to core advanced frameworks, model selection, benchmarking, fine-tuning and custom training and so on. From prototyping to production level real-time deployments, from computer systems/servers to edge devices cross-platform deployments. This guide will cover all the topics that are essentially needed to become zero-to-hero in Machine learning. In this documentation we will be focusing mainly on the object detection branch that belongs to Deep learning.

AI is simply the ability to think and act like humans. There are its branches:
Machine Learning > Deep Learning > Computer Vision.

**Machine Learning**: A branch of AI in which machines learn from labeled data patterns instead of fixed rules-based systems.
Three main types of Machine Learning:

**1: Supervised Learning 2: Unsupervised Learning 3: Reinforcement Learning.**

**Deep Learning**: Its branch of machine learning that is based on the special type of neural networks that learns complex patterns from data. It mainly falls under supervised learning where models are trained on labeled datasets to learn the mapping between inputs and outputs.

One of the special branches of deep learning is Computer Vision that uses Convolutional Neural Networks to learn complex patterns from data and perform predictions in different environments efficiently in real-time deployments as well. In computer vision, images are processed to extract meaningful features, which can then be used for various tasks such as classification, segmentation, and one of the most important applicationsâ€”object detection, where models not only recognize objects but also locate them within the image. In this guide we will deeply learn about object detection.

- Understanding of basic math (linear algebra, calculus)
- Familiarity with command line operations
- Python 3.8+ installed
- GPU with CUDA support (recommended for training)
- At least 8GB RAM (16GB+ recommended for training)

---

## Environment Setup

**Setting up development environment:** Create isolated Python environment to avoid dependency conflicts and install all necessary packages for object detection workflow.

First, set up your Python environment:

**File: `setup_environment.sh`**
```bash
# Create virtual environment to isolate dependencies
python -m venv ml_env

# Activate environment
# Windows:
ml_env\Scripts\activate
# Linux/Mac:
source ml_env/bin/activate

# Install PyTorch with CUDA support for GPU acceleration
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

# Install TensorFlow for alternative framework option
pip install tensorflow

# Install OpenCV for image processing operations
pip install opencv-python

# Install numerical and visualization libraries
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib

# Install ONNX for model export and deployment
pip install onnx onnxruntime

# Install MLflow for experiment tracking
pip install mlflow
```

## Object Detection

**Understanding object detection:** Object detection is a specific branch of computer vision that reads the images and detects the desired objects inside of the image along with their areas (x, y coordinates). Like if you input an image to the object detection model (YOLO, RF-DETR etc), it won't only tell that there is an object like cat/dog in the image, but also tells where they are by drawing bounding boxes on the areas and mentioning the class (name of object).

image input > model > inference > detection > output

![Object Detection](/images/onnxpy.png)

Like on this image we can see bounding boxes and the names of the objects like person and vehicle (bus) etc. That's the whole thing that is called object detection. It finds objects and labels objects within an image.

This was the verbal introduction of the object detection.
Now move towards all the technical details and requirements needed to develop, select, fine-tune and train the object detection model. From dataset collection to preprocessing.

---

## Object Detection Model Selection

**Choosing the right model:** When selecting the model for the object detection tasks first, we must thoroughly do research according to requirements and use case like where we want to deploy it and what we want to detect from it so this is the must check before moving forward towards data-preprocessing and fine-tuning. For example, you are developing a real-time security surveillance application that needs to detect events from the images under 50ms. Then model's speed shouldn't be compromised at any cost.

On the other hand if you are developing medical imaging system to analyze medical reports like X-rays, MRIs and CT-scans etc. to detect diseases then accuracy must be the top check. No any minor compromise on the accuracy no matter how long model takes to detect because here the use case isn't real-time so we can leverage the speed but not accuracy. But balance must be there in all cases.

---

### Model Performance Evaluation

**Evaluating model performance:** Now let's see what are the evaluation steps to compare the speeds and accuracies of different models and select the best one according to the requirements. These metrics help you decide which model fits your deployment scenario.

---

#### Speed Metrics

**Measuring inference speed:** These metrics tell you how fast your model can process images. Critical for real-time applications like surveillance or autonomous vehicles.

**Latency**: How long the model takes to process one image/frame (milliseconds). Lower latency means faster processing.

**FPS (Frames Per Second)**: How many frames model can process in 1 second. Valid for the real-time applications.

**Throughput**: Number of images processed per second when running in batch mode. Important for server deployments.

**Model Size**: Models' variants like nano, medium and large and the difference in speed and accuracy, the tradeoffs among them and what fits in the required use case.

---

#### Accuracy Metrics

**Measuring detection accuracy:** These metrics tell you how accurately your model detects and localizes objects. Critical for applications where missing an object or false detection can have serious consequences.

---

**1: Mean Average Precision (mAP)**

**What is mAP:** It evaluates how precisely model detects objects among crowded frames. It measures the accuracy of the model in identifying and localizing objects within an image. It combines precision (the proportion of correctly identified objects among all predicted objects) and recall (the proportion of correctly identified objects among all the actual objects). It gives a single score that shows how well model finds objects and how well it avoids false positives. A higher mAP means the model is more reliable and consistent. It helps to compare different models and select according to the use case and requirement.

**2: Recall**

**What is Recall:** The ratio of correctly predicted positive detections to all actual objects present. Out of all real objects present, how many did the model successfully detect. High recall = fewer false negatives. It evaluates the model's ability to capture every possible object without missing them. Recall is calculated by dividing true positives by the sum of true positives and false negatives. It ensures that even subtle and partially visible objects are not overlooked. Higher recall makes the model reliable for the scenarios where missing object is critical like medical imaging and security surveillance deployments.

**File: `metrics/recall_calculation.py`**
```python
"""

--------------------------
Recall measures the model's ability to find all objects.
Critical for applications where missing an object is costly.
"""


def calculate_recall(true_positives, false_negatives):
    """

    Recall = TP / (TP + FN)

        true_positives: Number of correctly detected objects
        false_negatives: Number of missed objects (present but not detected)

**3: Precision**

**What is Precision:** It measures the accuracy of a model's positive predictions, indicating the proportion of items predicted as positive that were actually correct. It is calculated as True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives). High precision means the model has few false positives. This metric helps you understand how trustworthy your model is when it predicts a specific outcome.

**4: IoU (Intersection over Union)**

**What is IoU:** It measures how much the predicted object bounding box overlaps with the real (ground truth) box. It's the ratio between overlap area/total combined area. Higher IoU = better prediction accuracy by the model. It compares the difference between ground truths and predictions, making visible the accuracy of the model. As visible in the image below green box is ground truth actual object area and the red box is predicted area by model so we can see slightly difference in overlapping of the boxes this visibly shows the accuracy of the model.

Certain threshold is set for predicting the class with accuracy.

## Data Preprocessing

**Why data preprocessing matters:** This is the most important and critical part of whole Machine Learning system. Whole performance of the model depends upon the dataset on which it's been trained. There is a famous saying (garbage in garbage out). Dataset must be cleaned, well balanced and must cover all the features that are required, and systems need to detect.

---

### Steps for Data Preprocessing

**Dataset splitting strategy:** Dataset is split into 3 folders: Train/Validation/Test. This splitting ensures model learns from training data, tunes hyperparameters on validation data, and evaluates final performance on unseen test data.

**Train**: This folder contains the larger amount of the dataset and models learn patterns and features from the images and annotations. Typically 70-80% of total data.

**Validation**: This folder is used during training to tune hyperparameters and monitor model performance. It helps prevent overfitting. Typically 10-15% of total data.

**Test**: This contains the final set of images that model hasn't seen before. It used after training to check how accurate the model has performed in real-time scenarios, simply testing the model on new images that were not included in the train dataset on which labels were drawn. Typically 10-15% of total data.

#### Data Augmentation

**Increasing dataset diversity:** This step of data-preprocessing plays vital role in model performance and generalization. This step includes rotation, flipping (horizontal/vertical) to increase diversity, scaling by zooming in/out to simulate objects at different distances, and brightness adjustment to simulate different lighting conditions like sunlight or cloudy weather. By training model on images with varying brightness, it learns to recognize objects accurately regardless of environmental changes. This helps reduce false positives and improves the model's performance for every condition.

#### Format Checking/Conversion

**Ensuring correct annotation format:** Every model has its own specific annotation format for reading labels. Annotations must be in the correct format.

**YOLO Format**: YOLO models use TXT file as label file containing (class + bounding boxes x, y coordinates) for each image file and names of both files image and label file should be exact same.
Example: "Image-1.jpg = image-1.txt"

![Yolo format labels file](/images/yololabel.png)

**Detectron2, Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN, RF-DETR**: These models take JSON files as annotations. This file contains the metadata of the dataset including the information of each image (filename, size), the objects in each image (bounding boxes, categories of the object like class) and also the list of all objects/classes. Annotations are linked to the corresponding images using ids.

### Data Preprocessing Platform

**[Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/)**

It's a web-based tool that has functionality to organize the data, preprocess including augmentation and format conversion among all the different models. It allows users to upload their dataset and annotate it, augment it, select the model and it will generate well balanced dataset including the Train & Test. It allows you to train model in it as well on some free credits, and then you can choose the "paid version".

![](/images/roboflow.png)
![](/images/code_snipper.png)

It guides you through all the necessary steps you need to complete and then generates an API key for direct dataset integration via API or as a downloadable .zip file.

Here you can select the model format.

### Dataset Collection

**Finding datasets:** Now comes the main part that where to find and get the dataset to train model, so the universal platform where multiple datasets are available is [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). It's widely used and most of the general datasets are available on it for free (check for the license of usage for each).

**Video Frames**

In case if dataset isn't available on this platform then we have second option: fetching frames from videos and real-time recordings and then defining the objects names. Let's assume you are collecting dataset for any company that has some products and they want to count all of them on the last stage of conveyor belt to count the production of units. So object can be anything special and not available, so then it comes that way of collecting dataset from the video recordings, just taking the video of those products where they are (e.g., on the conveyor belt) and then extracting frames from it using program as well (PYTHON).

This is the simple Python code snippet that can be used to extract frames from the videos to collect the dataset.

**File: `dataset_collection/extract_frames.py`**
```python
"""
Video Frame Extraction Script

    print(f"Duration: {total_frames/fps:.2f} seconds")

    # Calculate frame interval to get evenly distributed frames
    interval = total_frames // num_frames_to_extract

    count = 0
    extracted = 0

    while extracted < num_frames_to_extract:
        ret, frame = cap.read()
        if not ret:
            break

        # Extract frame at intervals
        if count % interval == 0:
            frame_filename = f"{output_folder}/frame_{extracted:05d}.jpg"
            cv2.imwrite(frame_filename, frame)
            print(f"Saved frame {extracted + 1}/{num_frames_to_extract}")
            extracted += 1

        count += 1

    cap.release()
    print(f"\nâœ“ Extracted {extracted} frames to {output_folder}")


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Set your variables here
    video_path = "input_video.mp4"
    num_frames_to_extract = 500
    output_folder = "dataset/frames"

    extract_frames_from_video(video_path, num_frames_to_extract, output_folder)
```

After you have collected your dataset images, you can use Roboflow to annotate them and convert the dataset into the format required by your model.

## Training

**Understanding the training process:** This step is similar to training any human being for doing a specific task. So like that AI models are also trained on the specific dataset to perform predictions based on the patterns learned from the dataset. To start the training firstly we prepare dataset (discussed earlier), then selecting a specific architecture of the model. We can do this by fine-tuning an existing pre-trained model (YOLO, RT-DETR etc) or by defining a custom architecture of the model using frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras etc. These frameworks provide libraries and packages to define, train, test and evaluate models.

When setting up for the training, hyperparameters are configured to control and manage the learning process. They influence how the training progresses and they directly impact the model's performance and efficiency. Like how, hyperparameters determine how quickly and effectively model learns from patterns of the data. Hyperparameters are epochs, learning rate, batch size, momentum and weight decay etc. Let's have a simple overview of each and see what is role of each hyperparameter for affecting the training process at all.

**Learning Rate**: Very crucial unit for the training process like it covers the 70% of the model efficiency during training process because it defines the steps models need to take to learn patterns from the data. It controls how much model's weights are updated during training. Too high can unstable the model training and too low can slowdown the training.

**Batch Size**: Number of random samples from the dataset are processed before model updates its weights.

**Epochs**: Number of times entire training dataset is passed through the model. More epochs let the model learn better. More epochs more iteration over the dataset and more detail learning.

**Momentum**: Used in optimizers to accelerate in consistent directions improving convergence speed.

**Weight Decay**: A regularization term added to prevent overfitting by penalizing large weights.

### PyTorch

**PyTorch framework:** Its an open-source framework that provides tools to build, train, and fine-tune models (neural networks). It provides each step we need to make a working model. It has vast network of libraries:
- torch for core operations and inference applications
- torchvision for computer vision image processing work. It has preloaded datasets that we can just import from library and the pretrained models that can be loaded to finetune them and also it provides the structure for defining custom models for different tasks
- torchaudio for audio processing
- torchtext for natural language processing tasks

### Fine-Tuning Models for Custom Detections

**Selecting models:** There are many state of the art object detection models that can be finetuned and integrated into applications. But there are some checks we need to see first before going ahead, e.g., License, Resources (Hardware), size and speed according to use case as we discussed earlier.

**1: RF-DETR** by [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/) is real-time transformer-based object detection model. It excels in both accuracy and speed, fit for most of the use case in application. It's licensed under Apache 2.0 so it can be used freely for commercial applications. It has variants that varies in speed and size to fit in with the environment.

| Variant        | Size (MB) | Speed (ms/image) |
| -------------- | --------- | ---------------- |
| RF-DETR Nano   | ~15 MB    | 2.3              |
| RF-DETR Small  | ~35 MB    | 3.5              |
| RF-DETR Base   | ~45 MB    | 4.5              |
| RF-DETR Large  | ~300 MB   | 6.5              |

RF-DETR nano fits for integration in edge devices, mobile apps and real-time application where speed is crucial and low-memory is required.
[RF-DETR-nano](https://github.com/aaliyanahmed1/ML-Guide/blob/main/RF-DETR_/rfdetr-nano.py)

RF-DETR small is slightly bigger but still it's fast and good fit for real-time applications and performs best on GPUs.
[RF-DETR-small](https://github.com/aaliyanahmed1/ML-Guide/blob/main/RF-DETR_/rfdetr-small.py)

RF-DETR base is ideal for server inferences for real-time application deployments.
[RF-DETR-base](https://github.com/aaliyanahmed1/ML-Guide/blob/main/RF-DETR_/rfdetrbase.py)

RF-DETR Large is heavy-weight model best for high accuracies on GPUs. Ideal to use where accuracy is more crucial than speed. Not ideal for real-time systems.
[RF-DETR-large](https://github.com/aaliyanahmed1/ML-Guide/blob/main/RF-DETR_/rfdetrlarge.py)

For training RF-DETR on custom dataset first preprocess the dataset using Roboflow and then download it according to the RF-DETR format by selecting format in Roboflow then feed it into the code and then start training by defining which model you want to train. Let's have a hands on example of it at all.
[FINE-TUNE-RF-DETR](https://github.com/aaliyanahmed1/ML-Guide/blob/main/RF-DETR_/train_rfdetr.py)

**2: YOLO** by [Ultralytics](https://www.ultralytics.com/) commonly used model throughout best fit for real-time applications and fast easy to finetune. It takes image of 640x640 pixels as standard input. But it's not under Apache 2.0 license so it can't be used freely for commercial applications. You have to pay to the company.

| Variant       | Size (MB) | Speed (ms/image) |
| ------------- | --------- | ---------------- |
| YOLO12 Nano   | ~14 MB    | 2.5              |
| YOLO12 Small  | ~27 MB    | 3.8              |
| YOLO12 Medium | ~44 MB    | 5.0              |
| YOLO12 Large  | ~89 MB    | 8.0              |

YOLO12n is ultralight and it's optimized for edge devices and real-time inferences can be used in applications where speed is required and hardware is small.
[yolo12n_code](https://github.com/aaliyanahmed1/ML-Guide/blob/main/Yolo_/YOLOS_/yolo12n_.py)

YOLO12s is balanced with speed and accuracy performs well comparatively nano variant when integrated on the GPU based hardware.
[yolo12s_code](https://github.com/aaliyanahmed1/ML-Guide/blob/main/Yolo_/YOLOS_/yolo12s_.py)

YOLO12m has significant accuracy difference from smaller ones and moderate speed ideal when deployed on server based inferences.
[yolo12m_code](https://github.com/aaliyanahmed1/ML-Guide/blob/main/Yolo_/YOLOS_/yolo12m_.py)

YOLO12Large is high-speed model best for where precision is crucial more than speed. Mainly for medical imaging systems.
[yolo12l_code](https://github.com/aaliyanahmed1/ML-Guide/blob/main/Yolo_/YOLOS_/yolo12l_.py)

[Fine-tuning YOLO](https://github.com/aaliyanahmed1/ML-Guide/blob/main/Yolo_/YOLOS_/training.py) - These are the simple implementations of the YOLO model variants for object detection tasks.

**3: Fast R-CNN** by Microsoft Research is a two-stage detector object detection known for its precision and high accuracy. It's slightly slower than other single-stage detectors. Two-stage detector means first it processes ROI (region of interests) in the image and then classifies and refines bounding boxes for each region this process reduces the false positive and overlapping of objects. That's why mostly it's used where speed and accuracy both are required and mainly it can be seen deployed on medical imaging systems. And its variants are mainly the backbones it uses like CNNs layers (ResNet-50, ResNet-101, MobileNet) which cause difference in speed and accuracy.

| Variant        | Backbone    | Size (MB) | Speed (ms/image) |
| -------------- | ----------- | --------- | ---------------- |
| Fast R-CNN 50  | ResNet-50   | ~120 MB   | 30               |
| Fast R-CNN 101 | ResNet-101  | ~180 MB   | 45               |
| Fast R-CNN M   | MobileNetV2 | ~60 MB    | 20               |

ResNet-50: This backbone is balanced for speed and accuracy so where both are crucial then this would be ideal fit and commonly from Fast R-CNN this backbone is commonly used.
[FastR-CNN-ResNet50](https://github.com/aaliyanahmed1/ML-Guide/blob/main/FasR-CNN_/fastrcnn_resnet50.py)

ResNet-101: This has higher accuracy and slower inference so it should be integrated on precision mandatory applications.
[FastR-CNN-ResNet101](https://github.com/aaliyanahmed1/ML-Guide/blob/main/FasR-CNN_/fastrcnn_resnet101.py)

MobileNet: This variant is again lightweight faster but accuracy is compromised so not so ideal.
[FastR-CNN_MobileNet](https://github.com/aaliyanahmed1/ML-Guide/blob/main/FasR-CNN_/fastrcnn_mobile.py)

These are the mostly used object detection models for commercial enterprise applications, research works and medical analysis. And all of them have multiple use case centric variants having specialization for the specific task. We have discussed them and now just we will make a list of all the possible open source object detection models that are available for integration in production grade applications, research and development etc.

## Hugging Face

**AI platform:** [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) is AI platform that provides tools, datasets and pre-trained models for Machine learning tasks. It has its wide transformer library that offer multiple ready to use open source models. It's called models zoo where you can get any type of model for GenAI, Machine learning, Computer vision and Natural language processing etc.

One of its most powerful feature is it provides inference API which allows to run models in cloud without setting up local environment, just using API for sending request and all the computation will be handled by Hugging Face. There are two ways to use it: 1) free API good for testing and personal use and 2) paid plan for large applications and faster responses.

Example to use Hugging Face API for inference:
```python
import os
from huggingface_hub import InferenceClient

client = InferenceClient(
    provider="hf-inference",
    api_key=os.environ["HF_TOKEN"],
)

output = client.image_segmentation("cats.jpg", model="facebook/mask2former-swin-base-coco-panoptic")
```

### Transformers

**Understanding transformers:** Transformers are type of deep learning architectures designed to handle sequential data using self-attention mechanisms instead of traditional or convolution. They excel at capturing long-range dependencies in data. Unlike older approaches that process sequences step by step, transformers compute relationships between all elements in a sequence simultaneously, allowing them to capture long-range dependencies. For our context we have to focus on ViTs (Vision Transformers).

**Computer Vision Transformers**: They adapt this architecture to computer vision by splitting an image into small patches, treating each patch like word in a sentence and applying same attention mechanism to learn how different parts of the image relate to each other. Mainly used for image-to-text, text-to-image transformers for generating captions and images.

**ViT (Vision Transformer)**: The first pure transformer for image classification, treating images as sequence of patches not as pixels.
[ViTs](https://huggingface.co/google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k); Hugging-Face.

**Swin-Transformer**: It uses shifted window attention mechanism for efficient scaling to high-resolution images. It excels in segmentation, detection and classification.
[swin](https://huggingface.co/keras-io/swin-transformers)

**BLIP/BLIP-2**: A Vision language model for tasks like image captioning, VQA (Visual Question Answering) and retrieval. It takes images as input and generate its caption by defining what's happening inside the image. BLIP-2 improves the efficiency by using pre-trained language models for better reasoning over visual inputs. Patches understanding goes to language models and then they generate accurate caption.
[Blip](https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/blip2-flan-t5-xxl)

**Florence**: Large scale vision foundation model for various multimodal vision-language applications. It supports tasks such as image-text matching, captioning in enterprise and real-world production grade deployments.
[florence](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Florence-2-base)

**Note**: These models like ViT, Swin-Transformer, BLIP/BLIP-2, and Florence are not ideal for real-time object detection on RTSP streams. They are mainly designed for high-accuracy image classification, vision-language tasks, and image captioning. These models typically require high-end GPUs with substantial memory (â‰¥16 GB VRAM) for inference and fine-tuning, and are generally unsuitable for CPU-only or edge deployments.

## Deployment

**Model deployment:** Deployment is very typical part of every Machine learning workflow. When it comes to deployment maintaining FPS for real-time systems becomes nightmare of MLOps architects so that's why the universal way to deploy model and maintain performance is to decouple it from training framework, that simplifies and reduces down burden of heavy dependencies and speed up the process is exporting model in ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) format. This simplifies integration of model and makes it compatible.

### ONNX

**Model format:** It is an open standard format for representing machine learning models. Exporting models to ONNX decouples them from the original training framework, making them easier to integrate into different platforms, whether on a server, multiple edge devices, or in the cloud. It ensures compatibility across various tools and allows optimized inference on different hardware setups, helping maintain real-time performance.

### ONNX Runtime

**Inference engine:** It is a high-performance inference engine designed to run ONNX models efficiently across different platforms. It takes the ONNX model and applies graph optimization, operator fusion and quantizations to reduce memory usage and computation time. So models run faster on servers, cloud environments and on multiple edge devices without needing original training framework. It can also speed up training process of large models by just making simple changes in code it can make training faster and efficient without changing workflow too much.

### Common Issues & Troubleshooting

**Resolving common errors:** When working with object detection models, you'll encounter various issues. Here are solutions to most common problems.

**1: CUDA Out of Memory Error**

```python
"""
Problem: RuntimeError: CUDA out of memory

Solution: Reduce batch size or use gradient accumulation
"""

# Bad - Large batch size
batch_size = 32  # Too large, causes OOM

# Good - Smaller batch with gradient accumulation
batch_size = 8
accumulation_steps = 4  # Effective batch size = 8 * 4 = 32

optimizer.zero_grad()
for i, (images, targets) in enumerate(train_loader):
    loss = model(images, targets)
    loss = loss / accumulation_steps
    loss.backward()

    if (i + 1) % accumulation_steps == 0:
        optimizer.step()
        optimizer.zero_grad()
```

**2: CUDA Not Available**

```python
"""
Problem: torch.cuda.is_available() returns False

Solutions:
"""

# Check CUDA installation
import torch
print(f"PyTorch version: {torch.__version__}")
print(f"CUDA available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}")
print(f"CUDA version: {torch.version.cuda}")

# If False, reinstall PyTorch with CUDA:
# pip uninstall torch torchvision
# pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

# Or use CPU fallback
device = 'cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu'
model = model.to(device)
```

**3: Slow Training Speed**

```python
"""
Problem: Training is very slow

Solutions:
"""

# 1. Use mixed precision training (FP16)
from torch.cuda.amp import autocast, GradScaler

scaler = GradScaler()

for images, targets in train_loader:
    optimizer.zero_grad()

    with autocast():  # Use FP16
        loss = model(images, targets)

    scaler.scale(loss).backward()
    scaler.step(optimizer)
    scaler.update()

# 2. Use multiple workers for data loading
train_loader = DataLoader(
    dataset,
    batch_size=16,
    num_workers=4,  # Use multiple CPU cores
    pin_memory=True  # Faster data transfer to GPU
)

# 3. Use DataParallel for multiple GPUs
if torch.cuda.device_count() > 1:
    model = nn.DataParallel(model)
```

**4: Model Not Learning (Loss Not Decreasing)**

```python
"""
Problem: Training loss stays constant or increases

Solutions:
"""

# 1. Check learning rate
learning_rate = 0.001  # Try different values: 0.0001, 0.01

# 2. Use learning rate scheduler
from torch.optim.lr_scheduler import ReduceLROnPlateau

scheduler = ReduceLROnPlateau(optimizer, mode='min', patience=3, factor=0.5)

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    train_loss = train_one_epoch()
    scheduler.step(train_loss)

# 3. Check data normalization
# Images should be normalized to [0, 1] or [-1, 1]
images = images / 255.0

# 4. Verify labels are correct
print(f"Sample labels: {targets[:5]}")
print(f"Label range: min={targets.min()}, max={targets.max()}")
```

**5: Poor mAP After Training**

```python
"""
Problem: Model achieves low mAP on validation set

Solutions:
"""

# 1. Train longer
epochs = 100  # Instead of 50

# 2. Use data augmentation
from torchvision import transforms

transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(p=0.5),
    transforms.ColorJitter(brightness=0.2, contrast=0.2),
    transforms.RandomRotation(degrees=10),
])

# 3. Adjust confidence and IoU thresholds
conf_threshold = 0.25  # Lower threshold finds more objects
iou_threshold = 0.45   # Adjust based on validation results

# 4. Check for class imbalance
from collections import Counter
class_counts = Counter([label for labels in dataset for label in labels])
print(f"Class distribution: {class_counts}")

# Use weighted loss for imbalanced classes
class_weights = compute_class_weights(class_counts)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss(weight=class_weights)
```

**6: Inference Too Slow**

```python
"""
Problem: Model inference is too slow for real-time use

Solutions:
"""

# 1. Use model.eval() and torch.no_grad()
model.eval()
with torch.no_grad():
    predictions = model(image)

# 2. Reduce input size
input_size = (416, 416)  # Instead of (640, 640)

# 3. Use TensorRT or ONNX Runtime
# Convert to ONNX first, then use ONNX Runtime
session = ort.InferenceSession("model.onnx")

# 4. Batch multiple images together
batch = torch.stack([img1, img2, img3, img4])
predictions = model(batch)  # Process 4 images at once
```

**7: OpenCV Video Capture Not Working**

```python
"""
Problem: cv2.VideoCapture() fails to open camera/stream

Solutions:
"""

# 1. Check camera index
for i in range(5):
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(i)
    if cap.isOpened():
        print(f"Camera {i} is available")
        cap.release()

# 2. For RTSP streams, add parameters
rtsp_url = "rtsp://username:password@ip:port/stream"
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(rtsp_url, cv2.CAP_FFMPEG)
cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_BUFFERSIZE, 1)  # Reduce latency

# 3. Check video file path
import os
if not os.path.exists(video_path):
    print(f"Error: File not found: {video_path}")
```

### Best Practices Summary

**Production deployment checklist:** Follow these guidelines for deploying object detection models in production.

**Performance:**
- Always use model.eval() during inference
- Use torch.no_grad() to reduce memory usage
- Batch images when possible for higher throughput
- Use GPU for training, consider CPU for edge deployment
- Profile code to find bottlenecks

**Model Optimization:**
- Export to ONNX for framework-independent deployment
- Apply quantization for 4x size reduction
- Use pruning to remove unnecessary weights
- Benchmark on target hardware before deployment

**Data Quality:**
- Clean dataset before training (remove duplicates, corrupted images)
- Use train/val/test split (70/15/15)
- Apply data augmentation for better generalization
- Balance classes to avoid bias

**Monitoring:**
- Track FPS and latency in production
- Log failed predictions for debugging
- Monitor GPU/CPU usage and memory
- Set up alerts for performance degradation

**Security:**
- Validate all input images
- Set file size limits for API uploads
- Rate limit API requests
- Use authentication for production APIs
