# Machine Learning Hands-On Guide

Hi, in this guide we are going to deeply learn about machine learning's fundamental concepts to core advanced frameworks, model selection, benchmarking, fine-tuning and custom training and so on. From prototyping to production level real-time deployments, from computer systems/servers to edge devices cross-platform deployments. This guide will cover all the topics that are essentially needed to become zero-to-hero in Machine learning. In this documentation we will be focusing mainly on the object detection branch that belongs to Deep learning.

AI is simply the ability to think and act like humans. There are its branches:
Machine Learning > Deep Learning > Computer Vision.

**Machine Learning**: A branch of AI in which machines learn from labeled data patterns instead of fixed rules-based systems.
Three main types of Machine Learning:

**1: Supervised Learning 2: Unsupervised Learning 3: Reinforcement Learning.**

**Deep Learning**: Its branch of machine learning that is based on the special type of neural networks that learns complex patterns from data. It mainly falls under supervised learning where models are trained on labeled datasets to learn the mapping between inputs and outputs.

One of the special branches of deep learning is Computer Vision that uses Convolutional Neural Networks to learn complex patterns from data and perform predictions in different environments efficiently in real-time deployments as well. In computer vision, images are processed to extract meaningful features, which can then be used for various tasks such as classification, segmentation, and one of the most important applicationsâ€”object detection, where models not only recognize objects but also locate them within the image. In this guide we will deeply learn about object detection.

- Understanding of basic math (linear algebra, calculus)
- Familiarity with command line operations
- Python 3.8+ installed
- GPU with CUDA support (recommended for training)
- At least 8GB RAM (16GB+ recommended for training)

---

## Environment Setup

**Setting up development environment:** Create isolated Python environment to avoid dependency conflicts and install all necessary packages for object detection workflow.

First, set up your Python environment:

**File: `setup_environment.sh`**
```bash
# Create virtual environment to isolate dependencies
python -m venv ml_env

# Activate environment
# Windows:
ml_env\Scripts\activate
# Linux/Mac:
source ml_env/bin/activate

# Install PyTorch with CUDA support for GPU acceleration
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

# Install TensorFlow for alternative framework option
pip install tensorflow

# Install OpenCV for image processing operations
pip install opencv-python

# Install numerical and visualization libraries
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib

# Install ONNX for model export and deployment
pip install onnx onnxruntime

# Install MLflow for experiment tracking
pip install mlflow
```

## Object Detection

**Understanding object detection:** Object detection is a specific branch of computer vision that reads the images and detects the desired objects inside of the image along with their areas (x, y coordinates). Like if you input an image to the object detection model (YOLO, RF-DETR etc), it won't only tell that there is an object like cat/dog in the image, but also tells where they are by drawing bounding boxes on the areas and mentioning the class (name of object).

image input > model > inference > detection > output

![Object Detection](/images/onnxpy.png)

Like on this image we can see bounding boxes and the names of the objects like person and vehicle (bus) etc. That's the whole thing that is called object detection. It finds objects and labels objects within an image.

This was the verbal introduction of the object detection.
Now move towards all the technical details and requirements needed to develop, select, fine-tune and train the object detection model. From dataset collection to preprocessing.

---

## Object Detection Model Selection

**Choosing the right model:** When selecting the model for the object detection tasks first, we must thoroughly do research according to requirements and use case like where we want to deploy it and what we want to detect from it so this is the must check before moving forward towards data-preprocessing and fine-tuning. For example, you are developing a real-time security surveillance application that needs to detect events from the images under 50ms. Then model's speed shouldn't be compromised at any cost.

On the other hand if you are developing medical imaging system to analyze medical reports like X-rays, MRIs and CT-scans etc. to detect diseases then accuracy must be the top check. No any minor compromise on the accuracy no matter how long model takes to detect because here the use case isn't real-time so we can leverage the speed but not accuracy. But balance must be there in all cases.

---

### Model Performance Evaluation

**Evaluating model performance:** Now let's see what are the evaluation steps to compare the speeds and accuracies of different models and select the best one according to the requirements. These metrics help you decide which model fits your deployment scenario.

---

#### Speed Metrics

**Measuring inference speed:** These metrics tell you how fast your model can process images. Critical for real-time applications like surveillance or autonomous vehicles.

**Latency**: How long the model takes to process one image/frame (milliseconds). Lower latency means faster processing.

**FPS (Frames Per Second)**: How many frames model can process in 1 second. Valid for the real-time applications.

**Throughput**: Number of images processed per second when running in batch mode. Important for server deployments.

**Model Size**: Models' variants like nano, medium and large and the difference in speed and accuracy, the tradeoffs among them and what fits in the required use case.

---

#### Accuracy Metrics

**Measuring detection accuracy:** These metrics tell you how accurately your model detects and localizes objects. Critical for applications where missing an object or false detection can have serious consequences.

---

**1: Mean Average Precision (mAP)**

**What is mAP:** It evaluates how precisely model detects objects among crowded frames. It measures the accuracy of the model in identifying and localizing objects within an image. It combines precision (the proportion of correctly identified objects among all predicted objects) and recall (the proportion of correctly identified objects among all the actual objects). It gives a single score that shows how well model finds objects and how well it avoids false positives. A higher mAP means the model is more reliable and consistent. It helps to compare different models and select according to the use case and requirement.

**2: Recall**

**What is Recall:** The ratio of correctly predicted positive detections to all actual objects present. Out of all real objects present, how many did the model successfully detect. High recall = fewer false negatives. It evaluates the model's ability to capture every possible object without missing them. Recall is calculated by dividing true positives by the sum of true positives and false negatives. It ensures that even subtle and partially visible objects are not overlooked. Higher recall makes the model reliable for the scenarios where missing object is critical like medical imaging and security surveillance deployments.

**File: `metrics/recall_calculation.py`**
```python
"""

--------------------------
Recall measures the model's ability to find all objects.
Critical for applications where missing an object is costly.
"""


def calculate_recall(true_positives, false_negatives):
    """

    Recall = TP / (TP + FN)

        true_positives: Number of correctly detected objects
        false_negatives: Number of missed objects (present but not detected)

**3: Precision**

**What is Precision:** It measures the accuracy of a model's positive predictions, indicating the proportion of items predicted as positive that were actually correct. It is calculated as True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives). High precision means the model has few false positives. This metric helps you understand how trustworthy your model is when it predicts a specific outcome.

**4: IoU (Intersection over Union)**

**What is IoU:** It measures how much the predicted object bounding box overlaps with the real (ground truth) box. It's the ratio between overlap area/total combined area. Higher IoU = better prediction accuracy by the model. It compares the difference between ground truths and predictions, making visible the accuracy of the model. As visible in the image below green box is ground truth actual object area and the red box is predicted area by model so we can see slightly difference in overlapping of the boxes this visibly shows the accuracy of the model.

Certain threshold is set for predicting the class with accuracy.

These are the steps needed to consider and critically evaluate before selecting and finalizing the model for the system.

## Data Preprocessing

**Why data preprocessing matters:** This is the most important and critical part of whole Machine Learning system. Whole performance of the model depends upon the dataset on which it's been trained. There is a famous saying (garbage in garbage out). Dataset must be cleaned, well balanced and must cover all the features that are required, and systems need to detect.

---

### Steps for Data Preprocessing

**Dataset splitting strategy:** Dataset is split into 3 folders: Train/Validation/Test. This splitting ensures model learns from training data, tunes hyperparameters on validation data, and evaluates final performance on unseen test data.

**Train**: This folder contains the larger amount of the dataset and models learn patterns and features from the images and annotations. Typically 70-80% of total data.

**Validation**: This folder is used during training to tune hyperparameters and monitor model performance. It helps prevent overfitting. Typically 10-15% of total data.

**Test**: This contains the final set of images that model hasn't seen before. It used after training to check how accurate the model has performed in real-time scenarios, simply testing the model on new images that were not included in the train dataset on which labels were drawn. Typically 10-15% of total data.
